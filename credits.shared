Most of the work here is original, but there are some notable exceptions:
 - Many sounds have been mixed and matched and filtered and whatnot from the following games:
   * Fallout New Vegas
   * Fallout 4
   * Unreal
   * Unreal Tournament
   * Unreal Tournament 2004
   * Unreal Tournament 3
   * Deus Ex
   * Thief
   * System Shock 2
 - In addition, a whole lot of stock sounds and internet meme sounds have also been used.
 - This mod uses Gutamatics, by Gutawer. Big thanks.
 - The crash handler uses a short clip of the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme.
 - Tewi font by lucy (https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font). Modified to add gradients and drop shadow.
 - Miniwi font by Josuah Demangeon (http://josuah.net). Modified to add gradients and drop shadow.
 - Slope alignment utility code by ZZYZX & Nash.
 - Extra gib anims for vanilla monsters:
   * Ryan Cordell (Demon, Cacodemon, Revenant, Archvile)
   * Amuscaria (Baron of Hell, Hell Knight)
   * Blox (Arachnotron, Mancubus)
 - SiFi270 (Less mean-spirited Keen replacement)
