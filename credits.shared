 - Many sounds have been mixed and matched and filtered and whatnot from the following games:
   * Fallout New Vegas
   * Fallout 4
   * Unreal
   * Unreal Tournament
   * Unreal Tournament 2004
   * Unreal Tournament 3
   * Deus Ex
   * Thief
   * System Shock 2
 - In addition, a whole lot of stock sounds and internet meme sounds have also been used.
